# Big Market Sales Prediction

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.

In this Repo we implement the Machine Learning models to predict the sales output of each outlet.
